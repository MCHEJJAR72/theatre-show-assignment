Setup and Structure:

Create a new repository on GitHub for the project.
Set up the basic file structure including HTML, CSS (or SCSS), and any necessary image assets.
HTML Structure:

Develop the HTML structure based on the provided mockup. Include sections for navbar, main image, flyer tiles (show details), and footer.
CSS Implementation:

Typography: Import and apply the Roboto font from Google Fonts.
Layout:
Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout structure (as per preference or requirement).
Ensure proper use of the Box Model for consistent spacing and sizing.
Navbar: Style the navigation bar with appropriate colors, fonts, and spacing.
Main Image: Set the background image for the main header section.
Flyer Tiles: Style each show flyer tile to display show information (title, dates, location, price) using appropriate CSS techniques (e.g., flexbox/grid for positioning elements within the tile).
Footer: Design the footer with necessary links and information, ensuring it complements the overall design.
Responsive Design:

Ensure the page is responsive using media queries or Bootstrap grid system.
Test responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes to ensure elements adjust correctly.
GitHub Repository:

Commit your code regularly with descriptive commit messages.
Push the code to GitHub and provide the repository link as required for submission.
Additional Considerations:

Validate your HTML and CSS to ensure it meets standards.
Optimize images and assets for faster loading times.
Consider accessibility best practices (e.g., using appropriate contrast ratios for text and background colors).
